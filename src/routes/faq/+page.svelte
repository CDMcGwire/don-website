<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>A base defense shooter in the vein of flash game classics like <em>Elona Shooter</em> and <em>Defend Your Castle</em> but with a satirical, political-sim twist. Shoot hordes of monsters, negotiate your operating budget, and navigate international rivalries, all for <strong style="color: #0397CC;">The Good of Humanity™️!</strong></p>
<h1>Who are you?</h1>
<p><strong>The Goodship Friendship!</strong> … A solo developer from the States attempting to do this professionally for the first time.</p>
<p>I like pizza, long walks in the rain, and arguing about what the genre “Action Adventure” even means.</p>
<p>(this will technically be one, by the by)</p>
<h1>When will the full game come out?</h1>
<p>Depends on what funding I can find. I didn't want to do Early Access only to discover that I won't be able to deliver a game I'm proud of for a few more years, so I'm just putting a preview demo out to show everyone the vision in action and we'll see where things go.</p>
<h1>What platforms do you plan to support?</h1>
<p>PC and Steam Deck primarily with high liklihood for Mac as well.</p>
<p>Mobile and Console support are also being kept in mind design-wise but not actively developed for.</p>
<h1>Why are you doing this?</h1>
<p><del>Money</del> Money.</p>
<p>Like they say. No easier path to riches than making art.</p>
<p>There's also something about having a passion for game design since I was a young kid and realizing that if I really want something to happen I need to just start doing it and all that.</p>
<p>But we'll just keep it simple with: “the money.”</p>
